NAME
    Queue::Memcached::Buffered - buffered queue API with read/write buffers

SYNOPSIS
        use Queue::Memcached::Buffered;

        my $queue = Queue::Memcached::Buffered->new({
            # or use memc => $memcached_object below:
            servers => ['127.0.0.1:11211', 'foo.bar.com:12345'],
            item_size => 1005,
            queue => 'queue_name',
        });
        for my $elem (@elems) {
            $queue->push_elem($elem);
        }
        $queue->flush; # don't forget this!

        while (my $elem = $queue->shift_elem) {
            # do something with $elem here...
        }

DIAGNOSTICS
    Queue::Memcached::Buffered throw exceptions when error occurs. Here's
    the list of the common error messages:

    failed to add item to <queue>: <memcached errstr>
        The "push_elem" method fails to push the JSON item to the remote
        memcached queue server. The raw error messages would be given at the
        end.

    failed to read item from <queue>: <memcached errstr>
        The "shift_elem" method fails to get a defined and non-empty JSON
        item from the remote memcached queue server. The raw error messages
        would be given at the end.

    failed to parse JSON <json_string>: <errors from JSON::XS>
        The server returns invalid JSON item and the "shift_elem" method
        cannot parse it with JSON::XS. The original error messages from
        JSON::XS is given at the end.

    invalid array returned from the server: <json string>
        The memcached queue server returns a valid JSON string but it's not
        a JSON array as a whole, but JSON object, strings, numerals, or
        booleans.
